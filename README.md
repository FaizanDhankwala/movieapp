Cinescop is a full-stack movie discovery web app built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Appwrite. It allows users to search and explore movies using the TMDB API with a debounced search experience that minimizes API calls. The app tracks trending movies based on user searches and displays them alongside real-time search results. Cinescop features a responsive design, smooth loading states with spinners, and secure data fetching using token-based authentication, all deployed through GitHub Pages.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
